# Hello-World
Tutorial for Github.
1) How to create a new branch:


    Go to your new repository hello-world.
    Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
    Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
    Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

2) Make and commit changes:
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

    Click the README.md file.
    Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
    In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
    Write a commit message that describes your changes.
    Click Commit changes button
